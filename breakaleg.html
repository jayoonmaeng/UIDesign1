      <h4>Idea sketches for utility to enhance your emotional feeling.</h4>
      <p>
        <br />
        I tried to make a Smashing web page which can visit when you feel bad or
        complex, disappointing. Write your wishes or bad thinking or whatever
        you want to remove in your head, just do it. even if it’s not gonna make
        you all gone, just take action to move on to another page on your daily
        life. hope you’re not get caught from negative influence which makes you
        depress and cannot focus on something else.<br />
        <br />“Break a leg!” means ‘wish you luck’ so I thought this idiom would
        be good for releasing your stress and getting starting with good luck.
        It could be also kinda brutal concept as human being, you can make icons
        with your concerns by typing things on leg. Once you’re all done with
        typing, you can click it as much as you want and leg will be separated
        (broke..). I am thinking I might want to put a breaking sound but it
        would be too cruel to be exposed in public.
